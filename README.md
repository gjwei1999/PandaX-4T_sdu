# PandaX-4T_sdu

This is a project for PandaX-4T under supervison of Prof. Meng Wang at Shandong University.

## Introduction
code1_SN generates the supernova burst neutrino spectrum.

code2 simulates the detection process and generates S1 & S2 signals.

code3 includes analysis for code2 and research for SN early warning algorithm.

code4 combines code1_SN, code2, and code3.

code5 for adaptive algorithm simulation(algorithm upgrade).
